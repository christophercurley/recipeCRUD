// Hello! I am currently working on 27.2 (https://www.qualified.io/assess/614df480d9edef0037cd6d04/challenges/614a006967b5840027bf75cc?invite=4z4zneLfCpGdhw) and am having trouble understanding why all tests are not passing. All intended functionality seems to be there but it doesn't pass some of the tests.
